# Learning period 12

I will be working together with my collegues on a Kanti school project (IDPA), we'll be creating an entire banking application including a web interface, mobile 2 factor auth, extensive backend for transactions and different accounts etc.

Epic: User can navigate the website and login to his banking account.
- [X] Implement /login /support (without any content/backend) according to mockups
- [X] Implement /neuanmeldung (without any content/backend) according to mockups
- [X] Implement navbar (without any content/backend) according to mockups

- [X] Pick up server in Zurich

✍️ Today I was able to implement the login, support, neuamledung pages and the navbar as well. I was also able to implement simple routing however there isn't any auth needed yet as this hasnt been yet implemented in the backend. I was also able to pick up the server in Zurich without any issues :)

Epic: User can all the important info at a quick glance on the dashboard page
- [X] Implement wealth box
- [X] Implement transactions box
- [ ] Implement chart box
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend
- [ ] Create unit & integration tests

✍️ Today I was able to implement the wealth box as well as the transactions box, I also created some new issues on which I'll be working on in the next few weeks (basically the epics in GH issue). I wasn't able to connect it to the backend yet as it's not fully implemented yet so I had to use backup data. I also wasn't able to implement charts yet but I'm very happy with how the dashboard page is looking and I was also able to make it pretty responsive. (I also made changed to the Navbar and Footer)
