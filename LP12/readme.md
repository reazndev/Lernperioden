# Learning period 12

I will be working together with my collegues on a Kanti school project (IDPA), we'll be creating an entire banking application including a web interface, mobile 2 factor auth, extensive backend for transactions and different accounts etc.


## 07.11
Epic: User can navigate the website and login to his banking account.
- [X] Implement /login /support (without any content/backend) according to mockups
- [X] Implement /neuanmeldung (without any content/backend) according to mockups
- [X] Implement navbar (without any content/backend) according to mockups

Unrelated:
- [X] Pick up server in Zurich

✍️ Today I was able to implement the login, support, neuamledung pages and the navbar as well. I was also able to implement simple routing however there isn't any auth needed yet as this hasnt been yet implemented in the backend. I was also able to pick up the server in Zurich without any issues :)
